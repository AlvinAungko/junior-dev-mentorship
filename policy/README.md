# Junior Dev Myanmar Policies

Junior Dev Myanmar strongly encourage diversity in many ways, age, cultural, gender, experience, thought, tech stack, and consciously work towards this.

# Workspace Diversity

Diversity in the workplace brings a range of perspectives, experiences, and ideas that lead to better decision-making and innovation. We recognize that diversity goes beyond gender, race, and ethnicity, and includes differences in age, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic background, and more.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where everyone feels valued, respected, and supported. We encourage open communication, active listening, and mutual understanding. We believe that everyone has a voice and deserves to be heard.

As an organization, we will continue to work towards creating an environment that embraces diversity and promotes equity. We will strive to provide equal opportunities for everyone to succeed and thrive.

# No Finger Pointing

As we work together towards achieving our goals, we want to remind everyone of our "No Finger Pointing" policy. This policy is intended to encourage a positive and respectful work environment where all team members feel safe and supported.

The "No Finger Pointing" policy means that we do not blame or accuse others when something goes wrong. Instead, we focus on finding solutions and working collaboratively to prevent similar issues from happening in the future.

If a mistake is made or an issue arises, we encourage open communication and problem-solving. We should all take responsibility for our actions and work together to find a solution, rather than engaging in blame or finger pointing.

This policy is essential in creating a culture of accountability, trust, and respect. By focusing on solutions and working together, we can achieve our goals more efficiently and effectively.

Thank you for your cooperation in maintaining this policy, and for your continued commitment to our shared mission.
